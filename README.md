# F-Zero GX Stage Editor
The goal of this project is to script tools and emulate data structures from Amusement Vision's 2003 Arcade Racer F-Zero GX for Nintendo GameCube in order to import and export proprietary files to and from the game.

# Why Unity?
Unity is a widely known game engine that uses C# as a scripting language. Unity already handles tasks such as rendering, object transformations, and many other necessary features for a level editor. Thus creating import and export functions, with components to mimic F-Zero GX's data will allow us to easily manipulate proprietary data. Additionally, Unity's extensibility will allow the community to script tools to facilitate level editing.
